#!/bin/bash

# While this script can be used anytime, it is best put to use in combination with a crontab.
# On Ubuntu for example you would enter crontab -e in a terminal and get something like this:
#
# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
#
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
#
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
#
# m h  dom mon dow   command

# To change the wallpaper every 5 minutes if the script is located in the $HOME directory, this would suffice:
# */5 * * * *  export DISPLAY=:0 && bash $HOME/randomgnomewp.sh > /tmp/cronerrors.log 2>&1

# If you configured your crontab, press Ctrl+X and then Y to confirm the changes.
# You should now have a new crontab installed.
# What now happens is, that the wallpaper changes every 5 minutes, should everything be properly configured in the crontab.
# If you don't see it change, there might be something wrong, so read the log the crontab creates: /tmp/cronerrors.log
